Project title: Brewery finder

Project description: Features the best rated local breweries in your area offering delivery and food services.

User story: 
As a beer drinker, I :
Want to keep drinking beer, discovering breweries, despite covid.
Figure out which breweries are open, and what purchase options they offer.
I also want to direct my limited funds to the best/most-deserving breweries in my area.
I want to do this easily, from home.

Wireframe/ sketch: User is greeted at the homescreen with app logo and a search field asking for the user's zipcode/city, saying "find local breweries near me." Once the user presses search, they are taken to a screen showing listed search results; 10 breweries near them. Each one will include the brewerie's logo/picture, their distance (in miles) from the user, and their rating out of 5 stars. Once the user selects a brewery, they are taken to a screen displaying more details about the brewery: full address, contact info, whether or not they deliver, and their pin on a map.
