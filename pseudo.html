    //vars to store input-initially, probably just declare var zipcode;
    //event: on click, presumably from landing page. sets zipcode. use a form there. rule of thumb-this is very much the last homework it feels like.
      //a bit outside our scope, but, presumably a small on click event/or additional lines of code to move to home page.
    //run search: this is the first thing to really figure out, how to structure call to get the results we want. how many queries can we use-as in, could we search zipcode+brewery? That would be easy.
    //No matter what, this is google api.
    //present let's say ten results w/ basic info extracted from JSONs:
      //another important question, touched on last time but would be good to nail down as much as possible: what do we want to display initially?
      //thinking-address, contact, logo-we did talk about this, there's a reference. 
      //could filter based on-rating? type? do they say they offer pickup?
      //one thing i've been thinking-if we're searching by zipcode, we can't really pull distance from user in a meaningful way. which-is easier anyway.
    //results generated dynamically-each one can function as button, should be simple to link it to a data-attr (name) that we can use in a follow up search.
    //honestly, that seems like solid baseline functionality-even without a third screen/detail search.
    //then we'll need code for a second event: on click interaction, presumably, but how we present more info, 
      //what kind of html we want to generate, is something where we'll need more front end input when we get there.
      //either way, we can build out a query.
      //if we manage to find a beer api, we use that here. doesn't have to be necessary per se so much as flavor-
        //like, if we could do a search for that brewery in a beer db, and list their three highest rated beers, i'll live with knowing if they're not on tap or not.
      //again, this is also a front-end thing, and also bonus, but a mouse-over event would be neat
    
    //big questions to me are-building out the queries, setting them up. how will we filter search, more then what we return.
    //also-how do we want to work, here? feels like three big areas-two api calls, then generating the elements for each.
